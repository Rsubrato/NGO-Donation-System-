<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This is a food donation app. User donate food through this app and volunteer will collect this food see information from app. And volunteer serve this food to helpless peoples.
<br>
Poverty and hunger are the main problem of our country. There are many NGO’s  that are working to minimize poverty and hunger in society. We have chosen a path to implement our innovative ideas in the form of this project named as NGO Donation System. The basic concept, which is emerged out from our project is to provide necessary items to the one in need. Our application provides a platform for donation of useful items (food, clothes, etc.) to the nearest NGO. Many people, institutes wish to donate things to needy organizations. Also, many organizations wish to ask for various things required by them. But there is no source available through which they can satisfy their requirements. Thereby, an android application through which people can donate items as per their capacity will be useful creating a bridge between Donor and NGO.
